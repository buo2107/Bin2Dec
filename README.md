Idea from [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md)

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Binary is the number system all digital computers are based on.
Therefore it's important for developers to understand binary, or base 2,
mathematics. The purpose of Bin2Dec is to provide practice and
understanding of how binary calculations.

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's
and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
constraints:

-   Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the
    sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for
    example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function
    to use.

## User Stories

-   [ ] As a user, I want to enter a variable number of binary digits in one input field, so that I can convert it
-   [ ] As a user, I want to be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered, so that I can fix it immedatily
-   [ ] As a user, I want to convert the binary digits to decimal number
-   [ ] As a user, I want to view the converted results on screen

## Bonus features

-   [ ] Decimal to Binary
-   [ ] Octal to Decimal, and convert
